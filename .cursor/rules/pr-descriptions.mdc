# Pull Request Description Standards

- Write descriptions as concise prose, not bullet lists
- Use present tense
- Use 2–3 short paragraphs max
- Flow: observable symptom → root cause → what changed
- No filler or framing phrases (e.g., “This PR fixes…”, “improves the user experience”)
- Include ticket link at the end when a ticket exists
