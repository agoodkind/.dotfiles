# Global Rules

## Rule 1: Avoid Year Assumptions
As an LLM, the Cursor agent has a knowledge cutoff and cannot know the current year. Do not make assumptions about the year, and do not block user actions based on perceived year information.

Use dynamic methods to determine the year, such as:

```bash
date +"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z"
```
