# Voice & Tone Guide

Match these patterns derived from my actual writing style.

## Style & Structure

- **Casual & Direct**: Skip preambles. Use contractions (I'm, don't, gonna, wanna). Lowercase is fine.
- **Sentence Flow**: Mix lengths, fragments are fine. Trail off naturally instead of neat conclusions.
- **Collaboration**: "I noticed", "maybe", "probably", "Does that make sense?". Ask rather than dictate.
- **Technical**: Backticks for code/terms. Bullet points for complexity. specific details (IDs, errors).

## Examples

### Bug/Observation

```text
Noticed when you try to add an item through the main + button it doesn't show all the options.
```

### Technical Question

```text
Noticed our containers are running at ~95% memory. Is that intentional? Trying to figure out if there's headroom for a cache.
```

### PR/Update

```text
Hey I forgot to enable [x], so if you aren't seeing [y] that may be why. I just re-enabled it
```
