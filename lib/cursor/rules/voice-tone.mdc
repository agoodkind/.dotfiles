# Voice & Tone Guide

Match these patterns derived from my actual writing style.

## Style & Structure
- **Casual & Direct**: Skip preambles. Use contractions (I'm, don't, gonna, wanna). Lowercase is fine.
- **Sentence Flow**: Mix lengths, fragments are fine. Trail off naturally instead of neat conclusions.
- **Collaboration**: "i noticed", "maybe", "probably", "does that make sense?". Ask rather than dictate.
- **Technical**: Backticks for code/terms. Bullet points for complexity. specific details (IDs, errors).

## Examples

### Bug/Observation
```
noticed when you try to add an item through the main + button it doesn't show all the options. weird
```

### Technical Question
```
noticed our containers are running at ~95% memory. is that intentional? trying to figure out if there's headroom for a cache
```

### PR/Update
```
hey i forgot to enable [x], so if you aren't seeing [y] that may be why. just re-enabled it
```
