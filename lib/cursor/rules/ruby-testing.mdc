# Ruby Testing Standards

## Type Safety

- Always add Sorbet `sig` blocks when adding new methods

## Linting

- Fix all RuboCop errors
- Avoid disabling RuboCop rules

## Test Quality

- Ensure tests run successfully
- Run broader test suite to verify no regressions
- Use `SecureRandom.uuid` or `Faker::Internet.uuid` for ID fields in tests
- Keep tests DRY - extract shared setup and data to helpers or `let` blocks

## Test Coverage

- Include end-to-end tests that execute through the full code path
- Avoid over-mocking internal methods that would bypass critical execution paths
