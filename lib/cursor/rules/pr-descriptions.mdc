# PR Description Standards

## Branch Naming Convention

Branches must follow: `username/TICKET-NUMBER/descriptive-name` (with slashes, not dashes)

**Examples:**
- ✅ `agoodkind/AG-10677/fix-silver-shimmer`
- ✅ `jsmith/PA-1234/add-silver-filter`
- ❌ `agoodkind-AG-10677-fix-silver-shimmer` (wrong: uses dashes)
- ❌ `AG-10677-fix-silver-shimmer` (wrong: missing username)

## Critical Rules

- **Prose Paragraphs**: Write descriptions as concise prose, NOT bullet lists
- **Present Tense**: Use present tense throughout
- **2-3 Paragraphs Max**: Keep descriptions brief and focused
- **Flow**: Observable problem → Root cause → What the PR does to fix it

## Title Rules

- **No Prefix Labels**: Avoid feat, refactor, fix, etc.
- **Direct Statement**: Use imperative mood, state what changed
- **Specific**: Be specific about what changed and where

## Description Structure

1. Start with the observable problem or symptom (what users/devs saw)
2. Explain what was actually wrong in the code
3. Describe what this PR does to fix it
4. Include implementation details when necessary
5. Acknowledge friction or concerns where relevant

## Prohibited Patterns

- Bullet lists or itemized formats
- Separate "benefits" sections
- Teaching how systems work
- Explaining obvious things
- "This PR fixes..." as an opener
- Filler phrases like "improves the user experience"
- Purpose clauses explaining why ("to improve...", "for better...")

## Examples

✅ Good Title:
- "Add amount validation to silver processor"
- "Reset list state on pull-to-refresh"

✅ Good Description:
"The silver elemental list was showing duplicate entries after pull-to-refresh. The issue was that fetchSilver was appending results instead of replacing them when the offset was zero. This PR resets the list state before fetching when triggered by refresh."

❌ Bad Title:
- "fix: Fix silver bug"
- "Update silver logic to improve reliability"

❌ Bad Description:
"This PR fixes a bug in the silver fetching logic. Previously the code was appending results incorrectly. Now it properly resets state. This improves the user experience by preventing confusion from duplicate items."
