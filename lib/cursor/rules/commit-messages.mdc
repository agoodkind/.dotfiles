# Commit Message Standards

## Rules

- **Imperative**: "Add", "Fix", "Update" (not "Added", "Fixes").
- **Concise**: No explanations, filler, or prefixes (feat:, fix:).
- **Direct**: State *what* changed, not *why* (unless critical).
- **Specific**: Avoid vague messages. Be specific about what changed.

## Examples

✅ **Good**

- "Remove unused import"
- "Add retry mechanism for failed requests"
- "Fix memory leak in connection pool"

❌ **Bad**

- "feat: Add retry mechanism to improve reliability" (No prefixes, no "to improve")
- "Fix bug" (Too vague)
- "Update logic" (Too vague)
- "Refactor netfilter modules to improve consistency and functionality" (Fluff: "to improve")
- "Changed target functions, enhancing clarity in their purpose" (Fluff: "enhancing clarity")
- "Improved the handling of DSCP and TTL values" (Fluff: "Improved")
- "Update validation logic to ensure data integrity" (Fluff: "to ensure")
- "Refactor code to enhance maintainability and streamline operations" (Fluff: "enhance", "streamline" - without fluff: "Refactor code" is meaningless)
- "Add error handling to improve user experience" (Fluff: "to improve")
